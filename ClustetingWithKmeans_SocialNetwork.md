================
Mohammed Zakaria

This exercise uses data from a Social Networking Service (SNS) that is
assumed to represent a wide cross section of American adolescents in
2006. The data was collected by Brett Lantz (see Machine Learning using
R, Ch 9 2nd ed.) The data was sampled evenly aross four high school
graduation years (2006 -
2009).

``` r
teens <- read.csv(file="C:/Users/mkzak/Documents/GitHub/FunWithR/FunWithR/10_kMeans/Data/snsdata.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```
