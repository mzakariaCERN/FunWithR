This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

We are trying to read a csv file. 

```{r}
table <- read.csv(file = "Evander Kane_events_20160923_074020_RN817490432.csv", sep = ",", skip = 4, header = TRUE)
```


Currently we will just add the acceleration as magnitude, regardless of the direction. 

```{r}
Acceleration <- mean(table$Hockey.Stride.Accel)
Acceleration_sd <- sd(table$Hockey.Stride.Accel)
Acceleration_15sd <- Acceleration_sd*1.5
Acceleration_2sd <- Acceleration_sd*2
Result <- c(Acceleration, Acceleration_sd, Acceleration_15sd, Acceleration_2sd)
print(Result)
```
