## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Required packages
```{r}
#install.packages("class") # for kNN classification
library(class)
#install.packages("gmodels") # for CrossTable function at the evaluation
library(gmodels)
```


```{r}
#plot(cars)
wbcd <- read.csv(file="C:/Users/mkzak/Documents/GitHub/FunWithR/FunWithR/1_kNN/wisc_bc_data.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

str(wbcd)
summary(wbcd)

# remove id

wbcd <- wbcd[-1]

```
