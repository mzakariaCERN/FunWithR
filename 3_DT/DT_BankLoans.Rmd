This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 


```{r libraries}

library(ggplot2)
```


Pulling the data: The cancer data is from Brett Lantz's "Machine Learning with R" a repo for the data is under this link: https://github.com/stedy/Machine-Learning-with-R-datasets/blob/master/credit.csv and original data can be found under https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml

```{r getting data}

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
