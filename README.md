## FunWithR
# Some code scripts I have been working on using R: 

1. 1_kNN  
Folder contains some exploritary work using kNN classification for Cancer data
[link](https://github.com/mzakariaCERN/FunWithR/blob/master/1_kNN/kNN_Cancer.md)

2. 2_NP  
Folder contains a study on using Naive Bayed for SMS classification
[link](https://github.com/mzakariaCERN/FunWithR/blob/master/2_NB/NB_SpamFilter.md)

3. 3_DT  
Folder contains a study on using Decision Trees for default prediction on data from a bank [link](https://github.com/mzakariaCERN/FunWithR/blob/master/3_DT/DT_BankLoans.md)

4. 4_RL
Folder contains a study using Rule LEarners (R1 and JRip) to classify mushrooms
[link](https://github.com/mzakariaCERN/FunWithR/blob/master/4_RL/RL_Mashroom.md)

5. 5_Regression
Folder contains a study using Linear Regression to predict medical expenses 
[link](https://github.com/mzakariaCERN/FunWithR/blob/master/5_Regression/LinReg_MedicalExpenses.md)

All studies use caret library for tuning using ROC

1. UsefullLibraries: lists the libraries that I have encountered and deemed useful. Sort of a bookmark [link](https://github.com/mzakariaCERN/FunWithR/tree/master/Resources)

1. Scrapping_NHL.R: Designed to scrap data from NHL website for minutes played by each player of the team for that game. Please see comments in the source file. 
2. CalculateNHLBands.Rmd: A short example on how to calculate the acceleration bands from a  5-column csv file. After finding the average acceleration, we calcualte the Standard deviation, and then make thresholds (band) using 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 times the standard deviation.
