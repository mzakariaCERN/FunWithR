# FunWithR
Some code scripts I have been working on using R: 

1. 1_kNN  
Folder contains some exploritary work using kNN classification for Cancer data  

2. 2_NP  
Folder contains a study on using Naive Bayed for SMS classification  

3. 3_DT  
Folder contans a study on using Decision Trees for default prediction on data from a bank  

All studies use caret library for tuning using ROC

1. Scrapping_NHL.R: Designed to scrap data from NHL website for minutes played by each player of the team for that game. Please see comments in the source file. 
2. CalculateNHLBands.Rmd: A short example on how to calculate the acceleration bands from a  5-column csv file. After finding the average acceleration, we calcualte the Standard deviation, and then make thresholds (band) using 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 times the standard deviation.
